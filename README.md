I am Sai Varshith
My hobbies are:
1.listening to music
2.playing chess
3.learning new stuff

The thing I like a lot about the git os the fact that it creates a public environment for people to work together

The python problem which i had enjoyed solving the most is to return the largest palindromic substring in a gicen string
